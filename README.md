Made this to practice and get into C++. \
`src/dist` has an executable, so you don't have to build from scratch.

### UPDATE Aug. 16, 2024
Why are people forking and using this ðŸ˜­. \
If this gets another fork or star, I might come back and rewrite this project.

## To-do

- [ ] Add support for other actions, right now sitting is the only one that is rendered.

- [ ] Learn proper C++ conventions and make the code better/more readable.
- [ ] Make a Linux version.
