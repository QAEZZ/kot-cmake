# Oneko Desktop

**Still not done.**

For some reason this repo got 5 stars and 2 forks, so I'm rewriting this. \
This project was initially intended for me to learn C++, however, I will be rewriting this in C using Raylib, instead of C++ and GLFW.

This rewrite will also support Linux, MacOS, and Windows; whereas the previous version only support Windows (used Windows-only libraries.)

I expect this rewrite to be done within a week, if my schedule remains open.

For the old version, head to the `old` branch.


## TODO
